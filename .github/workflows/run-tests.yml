    # 5. STEPS - Sequential commands to execute
    steps:
      # Step 1: Clone your repo code into the runner
      # "uses" means we're using a pre-built action from the Marketplace
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Install PHP with extensions your Laravel app needs
      - name: Setup PHP 8.4
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: '8.4'
          extensions: mbstring, pdo, pdo_mysql, redis, xml, ctype, json, bcmath
          coverage: none  # Set to 'xdebug' if you want code coverage reports

      # Step 3: Cache Composer dependencies (speeds up future runs)
      # First run: ~60s to install. Cached runs: ~5s
      - name: Cache Composer dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: vendor
          key: composer-${{ hashFiles('composer.lock') }}
          restore-keys: composer-

      # Step 4: Install PHP dependencies
      - name: Install Composer dependencies
        run: composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader

      # Step 5: Prepare the environment file
      # We copy .env.example and override values for CI
      - name: Prepare environment
        run: |
          cp .env.example .env
          php artisan key:generate

      # Step 6: Run database migrations
      - name: Run migrations
        run: php artisan migrate --force
        env:
          DB_CONNECTION: mysql
          DB_HOST: 127.0.0.1
          DB_PORT: 3306
          DB_DATABASE: medlucy_test
          DB_USERNAME: root
          DB_PASSWORD: password
          REDIS_HOST: 127.0.0.1
          REDIS_PORT: 6379

      # Step 7: Run the test suite
      - name: Run tests
        run: php artisan test
        env:
          DB_CONNECTION: mysql
          DB_HOST: 127.0.0.1
          DB_PORT: 3306
          DB_DATABASE: medlucy_test
